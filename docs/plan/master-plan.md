# Master Plan

**Baseline:** Project restart from zero — 2026-06-23  
**Active phase:** P19 — Template verifiability, publish gate & decision forms (**In Progress**, 2026-06-25). P20 i18n **Done** (2026-06-25).  
**Next planned phase (P14, renumbered 2026-06-23):** Confirmed large domains — clause/
content module lifecycle, collaboration to-dos + timeout escalation, and template
export/import. See UX-G in
[ux-upgradeability-optimization-plan.md](./ux-upgradeability-optimization-plan.md).
UX-A…UX-F interaction/upgradeability tasks (same plan) run as optimization waves
against the existing implementation. **UX Wave A** (role gating + half-built interactions)
re-earned Done on 2026-06-23; **UX Wave B** (workbenches + polish) is In Progress.
P12 remains the non-active deferred-enhancements
catch-all (no single active slice). **P15 (Kubernetes deployment & container
hardening)** is newly planned to implement the unrealized Docker/K8s operational
baseline from ADR-0030; it is `Not Started` and does not change the active phase (none).
**P16–P20 (deep-review functional gaps, 2026-06-23)** are newly registered confirmed-but-
unplanned domains — lifecycle/version governance completeness (G1), per-domain API policy
governance (G2), structured authoring & fidelity engine (G3), verifiability/publish-gate +
decision forms (G4/G5), and i18n multi-locale + UI upgradeability (G6). All are `Not Started`
and do not change the active phase (none — no single active phase slice).

## Product goal

Build an enterprise low-code document generation platform for bank correspondence:
template lifecycle, dynamic generation API, API authorization, DOCX/PDF output with
optional dynamic encryption. v1 does not provide a customer-facing generation portal;
upstream systems invoke the dynamic API.

## Delivery strategy

1. **Thin vertical slice first** — one end-to-end path before breadth.
2. **Test-first** — behavior spec → failing test → implementation → green gates.
3. **Document-as-code** — update docs with or before behavior changes.
4. **English-first i18n** — all user-facing strings via message keys.

## Thin vertical slice (MVP chain)

Target before expanding breadth:

```text
Login → upload & approve master → create template → configure variables/content
  → test generate → submit test/approval → publish
  → configure minimal API policy → sync generate DOCX via runtime API
```

Phases involved: **P0 → P1 → P2 → P3 → P4 → P5 → P6 → P7 (minimal sync path)**.

## Active phase rule

- Only one phase row may be `In Progress`.
- Activate the next phase only when the prior phase exit criteria are met and marked `Done`.
